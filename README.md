Notes:
- Programmed in C using Visual Studio 2022. Google Tests framework used.
- There is no actual executable part attached to this program. **All functionality is called using the test script.**
- Queue functionality is implemented using a dynamic list. I have done this in C using void pointers and memory allocation because void pointers do not need size information at compile time. I have emulated vector functionality with my implementation.
- All inputs are processed as **strings** within the code. We do no calculations with the items in the queue so this is chosen to ensure maximum input compatibility. Refer to comments in implementation for a bit more info.

How to use:
- Clone this repository into a folder
- Open the "Queue.sln" file using Visual Studio.
- In the "Tests" tab, open "Test Explorer".
- Run each test category.
